# Dynamsoft Content Style Guide
## Writing Goals and Principles
**Speak truth**   
Avoid dramatic storytelling and grandiose claims. Focus on our real strengths.

**Clear**   
Understand the topic you’re writing about. Use simple words and sentences.

**Useful**   
Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?

**Friendly**   
All of our content, from homepage copy to system alerts, should be warm and human.

**Brief**   
Avoid long text
Use unordered Lists

## Grammar and Mechanics
**Abbreviations and acronyms**   
If there’s a chance your reader won’t recognize an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time you mention it. Then use the short version for all other references. If the abbreviation isn’t clearly related to the full version, specify in parentheses. 

* First use: Dynamic Web TWAIN   
* Second use: DWT   
* First use: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)   
* Second use: UTC   

If the abbreviation or acronym is well known, like API or HTML, use it instead 

**Capitalization**   
We use a few different forms of capitalization. Title case capitalizes the first letter of every word except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. Sentence case capitalizes the first letter of the first word. (H1)

**Numbers**    

Numbers over three digits get commas:   

* 499   
* 1,000   
* 150,000   
Abbreviate big numbers if there are space restraints, as in a tweet or a chart: 1k, 150k.

**Dates**   
Spell out the day of the week and abbreviate the month, unless you’re just referring to the month or the month and the year.   

* Saturday, Nov. 24   
* Saturday, Nov. 24, 2017   
* November 2017

Use a hyphen (-) to indicate a range or span of numbers.

When writing about other currencies, follow the same symbol-amount format:   
* ¥100

**Telephone numbers**

**Position and form**

					3. Resources

**Lists** 

* Use lists to present steps, groups, or sets of information. Give context for the list with a brief introduction.    
* Number lists when the *order* is important, like when you’re describing steps of a process.  Use dots rather than numbers when the list’s order doesn’t matter.   
* If one of the list items is a complete sentence, use proper punctuation and capitalization on all of the items.
